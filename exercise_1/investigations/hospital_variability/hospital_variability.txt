Below is a list of 10 procedures that experience the highest variance in scores across hospitals between effective care and readmission procedures.
Since variance measures variability in the score, I believe this is the best approach to measure
procedural variability across hospitals.

Measure_ID	Measure_Name															Agg_Score	Avg_Score	Var_Score
ED_1b   	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients   	954970   	205.11  	20147.57
